STEP 1: RUN LOCALLY
===================

STEP 2: EXPOSE TO INTERNET (EASIEST)
════════════════════════════════════

Use NGROK for free exposure:

1. Download NGROK from: https://ngrok.com/download

2. Extract it

3. Run in a terminal:
   ngrok http 5000

4. You get a public URL like:
   https://xxxxx-xx-xxx-xxxx.ngrok.io

5. Share this URL with anyone
   They can control your phone from their browser!


STEP 3: PERMANENT HOSTING (Optional)
═════════════════════════════════════

Option A: RENDER (Recommended - Free)

- Deploy automatically
- URL: https://ai-phone-agent.onrender.com

Option B: HEROKU
- Go to: https://www.heroku.com

IMPORTANT NOTES
═══════════════

1. Phone Connection:
   - Phone must be connected to PC via USB
   - PC must be running the server
